# Proof of Concept

This project is a proof of concept for automation testing using Selenium and Java, following best practices for maintainability, scalability, and clarity. It demonstrates a modular test automation framework that integrates Cucumber for BDD (Behavior Driven Development), JUnit for test execution, and ExtentReports for reporting.

## Features

- **Modular Project Structure:** Organized into logical packages for easy navigation and maintenance.
- **Selenium WebDriver Integration:** Automates browser actions for end-to-end testing.
- **Cucumber BDD:** Write test scenarios in plain English using Gherkin syntax.
- **JUnit Integration:** Executes tests and integrates with Maven for CI/CD pipelines.
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Encapsulates UI locators and actions for reusability.
- **Custom Utilities:** Includes helpers for WebDriver actions, screenshots, logging, and reporting.
- **Configurable Execution:** Supports local and remote (grid) execution, browser selection, and environment configuration via properties files.
- **Rich Reporting:** Generates detailed HTML reports with screenshots using ExtentReports.
- **Error Handling:** Robust exception handling and assertion utilities.

## Frameworks & Libraries Used

- **Selenium WebDriver:** For browser automation.
- **Cucumber:** For BDD-style test definitions and feature files.
- **JUnit:** For running and managing test cases.
- **ExtentReports:** For generating interactive test reports.
- **Maven:** For dependency management and build automation.
